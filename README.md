# matray
## A Manjaro Linux announcements notification app (successor of mntray)
</br>

[![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/tag/moson-mo/matray.svg?label=release&sort=semver)](https://github.com/moson-mo/matray/releases)

A small tray application showing announcements and news for [Manjaro Linux](https://manjaro.org).\
It creates a tray icon with a menu showing the latest announcements from the Manjaro Forum RSS feed & "manjarolinux" twitter account.

This project is the successor of [mntray](https://github.com/moson-mo/matray) and has been re-developed in [Vala](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Vala).\
[Gtk](https://www.gtk.org/) serves as a basis for the GUI part.\
Main reason for the re-development is that qt library binding used by mntray does not seem to be maintained anymore (last commit in Sep. 2020).

Announcements are retrieved from a http server (see [mnserver](https://github.com/moson-mo/mnserver/)) via post request.

Why is it connecting to a server application rather then parsing the RSS feed directly?\
The RSS feed can be quite large (around 300 to 500 KB).\
Instead of downloading this file from the Manjaro forums host on a regular basis, it fetches news from mnserver.\
There's much less data to be transferred and less burden on the forum host and client since the data is stripped down to the bare minimum.

## How to build
* Install build dependencies `sudo pacman -S libgee vala`
* Download this package with: `git clone https://github.com/moson-mo/matray`
* Change to package dir: `cd matray`
* Build: `meson build && ninja -C build`
* The binary will be in the `build` dir
</br>

## How to install

Binaries are available from the [releases](https://github.com/moson-mo/matray/releases) page.\
Use "install_icons.sh" script in order to install the required icons.

For Arch-based distributions there is an [AUR package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/matray/) available.

## Configuration

On the first startup a config file (`~/.config/matray/config.json`) is created with some default settings.
You can either use the GUI to change the configuration (open "Settings" from the menu) or edit the config file.
